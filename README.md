How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?


    By adding more parameters, more operations could be completed within the function. For example, in Task 4, there are 11 if statements in one function because I could verify so many conditions related to all the parameters. All the parameters were also available to me for equations within the function like adding and multiplying the parameters to get new variables and outputs.


What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?


    It was difficult to determine when to use several if statements vs. a switch statement. For this exercise, I used if  and if else statements as often as I could to get the practice and better understand the logic.
    I don't fully understand where "return" returns to. Within nested if statements, it seemed like sometimes it returned directly outside the if statement and, other times, it returned to the main function.


How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?


    We're constantly learning, so it's always possible to make things more efficient and eliminate lines of code when we take another look at our code. When technology updates or user needs become more apparent, simple, readable code helps to implement the updates.
